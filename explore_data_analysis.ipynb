    "EDA is an iterative process that aims to discover patterns, detect anomalies, and extract insights from data. It involves examining the underlying structure, relationships, and distributions within a dataset before diving into complex modeling or hypothesis testing. By adopting a systematic approach to EDA, you can develop a comprehensive understanding of your data, leading to more effective problem-solving and actionable outcomes.  \n",
